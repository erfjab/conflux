# Conflux (کانفلاکس)

Conflux means **flowing towards a common point**. This name was chosen because our goal is to **merge multiple Marzban panels into a single unified panel**.

# How to Use

The script consists of three main sections: **Export**, **Import**, and **Handler**. Each section has its own dedicated documentation.

> **Note:** This script is developed for **Marzban version 0.8.4** and does not support newer or older versions.

1. [**Export Data**](doc/export.md)  
2. [**Import Data**](doc/import.md)  
3. [**Sub Handler**](doc/handler.md)
